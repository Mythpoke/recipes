        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This fruit salad is perfect for a backyard bbq or any occasion.
             There are never leftovers! This is one of my favorite fruit salad recipes,
              as I think the citrusy sauce really makes it.
               <p>This salad is tastier the longer you can let it soak in its juices.
                I prefer 3 to 4 hours in the refrigerator before I serve it.</p></p>
